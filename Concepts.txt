INITIAL CONCEPTS

What I want to do is have a total Halo upgrade for barotrauma; inspired by the existing 40K mod. Below
I will outline may be done:

--Ideally, the whole UNSC armory should be covered, including armor variants for specific roles(ie; ODST)
    -.Inspiration can be taken from Arma3 OpTRE.
    -.This includes all variants of Spartan armor, including Mk4,5,6,7 if possible.
        ..Some armors will be better suited for specific tasks (such as Mk6 EVA, being used to leave the ship).
        ..Parts can be "assembled" (TBD what this will actually look like)

--The addition of Covenant enemy types and their respective units (Elite SF squads etc.)
    -.Plasma weapons: Inflict burn damage (or brand new affliction) to player and damage energy shields (see line 22)

--Total Spartan conversion surgeries that can be performed in-game (see https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/SPARTAN-II_augmentation_procedures and https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/SPARTAN-IV_augmentation_procedures)
    -.Afflictions (or other method)/permanent buffs to characters after surgery.
    -.Larger bodies for any character turned into a Spartan.
    -.Only Spartans can wear certain armor to incentivize surgery.

--New roles (Marine, Commander, Spartan) as well as talents for existing ones.

--Introduction of energy shielding as part of wearable armor, that can be recharged/has a cooldown like in the Halo games.

These are all just ideas for now.
